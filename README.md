# Simple Digital Clock

## Project Overview

The Simple Digital Clock is a web development project that displays the current real-time clock in the browser.

The clock updates automatically every second using JavaScript and shows the current hours, minutes, and seconds in digital format.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for real-time functionality.


## Features

- Displays real-time system clock
- Updates automatically every second
- 12-hour or 24-hour time format support

## Project Structure

```

## How It Works

1. HTML creates the structure of the clock.
2. CSS styles the clock layout and appearance.
3. JavaScript uses the Date object to get current time.
4. setInterval function updates the time every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
5. The updated time is displayed dynamically on the webpage.
